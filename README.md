# Amazon-Clone-Project
This repository hosts a simplified version of Amazon's user interface, built solely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript . While it doesn't have the full functionality of the live site, it aims to replicate the look and feel of Amazon's homepage and product listings. It also contains the LogIn page and SignIn page. Tries to make as similer as it is..
